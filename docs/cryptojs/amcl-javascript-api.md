*MCJS - Milagro Crypto JavaScript*

* MCJS is a standards compliant JavaScript cryptographic library with no
external dependencies except for the random seed source.

* MCJS supports the standards for RSA, ECDH, ECIES, ECDSA and M-PIN, AES-GCM
encryption/decryption, SHA256, SHA384, SHA512 and SHA3 hash functions and a
cryptographically secure random number generator. Furthermore we recently
added New Hope, a post-quantum key exchange.

* MCJS is [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) compatible and browser compatible
(see some examples below).
