The Apache Milagro (incubating) website
============================

Milagro is a set of crypto libraries and core security infrastructure applications, built for decentralized networks yet suitable for enterprises.

Milagro has several repos. The C and JavaScript versions of the core cryptographic libraries have had major releases, and are production ready, while the Rust version is under development:

* [Milagro Crypto C Library](https://github.com/apache/incubator-milagro-crypto-c)
* [Milagro Crypto JavaScript Library](https://github.com/apache/incubator-milagro-javascript)
* [Milagro Crypto Rust Library](https://github.com/apache/incubator-milagro-crypto-rust/)

Applications being developed on these cryptographic libraries include the Milagro ZKP-MFA server and the Milagro Decentralized Trust Authority (D-TA). The Milagro D-TA is now at an alpha release stage.
