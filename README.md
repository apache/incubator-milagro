The Apache Milagro (incubating) website
============================

Milagro is a set of crypto libraries and core security infrastructure applications, built for decentralized networks yet suitable for enterprises.

Milagro has several repos. The application repos are being overhauled to reflect new, modern architectures. Expect these to be merged into a Milagro ZKP-MFA server repo, and a Milagro Decentralized Trust Authority (D-TA) repo. More detail is available at:

* [Milagro JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MILAGRO/issues/MILAGRO-18?filter=allopenissues)
* [Milagro Wiki](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=115529045)

The most current libraries are the core crypto libraries:

* [Milagro Crypto C Library](https://github.com/apache/incubator-milagro-crypto-c)
* [Milagro Crypto JavaScript Library](https://github.com/apache/incubator-milagro-javascript)

For the time being, only the C, JavaScript & Rust libraries are being supported going forward.
