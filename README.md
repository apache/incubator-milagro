The Apache Milagro (incubating) website
============================

Milagro is a set of crypto libraries and core security infrastructure applications, built for decentralized networks yet suitable for enterprises.

Milagro has several repos. The application repos are being overhauled to reflect new, modern architectures. Expect these to be merged into a Milagro ZKP-MFA server repo, and a Milagro Decentralized Trust Authority (D-TA) repo. More detail is available at:

* [Milagro JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MILAGRO/issues/MILAGRO-18?filter=allopenissues)
* [Milagro Wiki](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=115529045)

The C and JavaScript versions of the core cryptographic libraries have had major releases, and production ready, while the Rust version is under development:

* [Milagro Crypto C Library](https://github.com/apache/incubator-milagro-crypto-c)
* [Milagro Crypto JavaScript Library](https://github.com/apache/incubator-milagro-javascript)
* [Milagro Crypto Rust Library](https://github.com/apache/incubator-milagro-crypto-rust/)

Note that only the C, JavaScript & Rust are being developed and supported going forward.
