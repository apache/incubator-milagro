  "description": "The Milagro D-TA aims to provide an auditable record of all interactions between actors in the system. It is vital that all the actors in the system can refer to an agreed record of these transactions in case of dispute or in response to requests from third parties such as law enforcement, audit or compliance organizations.  The Milagro D-TA creates immutable, secure and attributable records of every interaction that occurs in the lifecycle of entities and their dealings with secrets. We do this using the Inter Planetary File System - IPFS.",
