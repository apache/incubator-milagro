Therefore, pairing-based cryptographic schemes would make a nice addition to NIST\u2019s cryptographic toolkit. In particular, we have focused attention on IBE. IBE simplifies key management procedures of certificate-based public key infrastructures. IBE also offers interesting features arising from the possibility of encoding additional information into a user\u2019s identity.  It has been a decade since the first IBE schemes were proposed.
